3 LOVE YOURSELF
Never make the mistake of failing to love yourself before loving
someone else - because if you don't love yourself, how will you love
them? To love yourself means to invest in your personal growth, to
work on being the best version of you. Physically, mentally, spiritually
and emotionally. You become a seed which you, yourself water on a
daily basis in order to grow. The same principle applies when you want
to love someone else - to keep the love strong, you would water it by
giving them attention, care, respect, and SO much more. But focus on
doing all these things to yourself first. Love yourself first.
